# Deep_Shallow_ml_devel
Machine Learning Environment setup and Development

set up virtual environment with:
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.5 /path/to/venv

Once created, activate with
source ./venv/bin/activate 

Shallow Learning Models were adapted from Robert (LordNorbi).

Deep Learning Models were adapted from Robert Hamsch



## Machine Learning

The Machine Learning models can be found in /models/*

## Running

The scripts can be run via the python files or ipynb notebooks. The notebooks load the appropriate functions from the
*.py files. Jupyter notebooks are convenient because of the quick results and graphical interface. In terms of functionality
they are both the same.
