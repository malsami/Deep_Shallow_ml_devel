        Attributes
        ----------
        input_size: int

            First layer of the neural network corresponds to the size (dimension) of the training data

        hidden_size_1: int

            Hidden layer size chosen by user

        hidden_size_2: int

            Hidden layer size chosen by user

        num_classes: int

            Number of classes will determine the final layer and respective activation function

        Methods
        -------

        forward(x)
            Forward pass of torch model. Will define how data is propogated and computed on in the graph.

    def forward(self, x):
        """
        Forward pass for pytorch model which computes on x (training data) as it is propogated through network.


        Parameters
        ----------
        x : numpy array [N x D]
            training set samples where n is number of samples and d is the dimension of each sample

        y : numpy array [N x 1]
            training set labels where each sample is either '1' or '0'.

        Returns
        -------
        x: int
            Classification result '1' or '0'
